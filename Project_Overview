# PHASE 1 — PROJECT OVERVIEW + BUSINESS PROBLEM + SCOPE

---

## 1. OpenEMR Patient Scheduling & Workflow Optimization
**OpenEMR Patient Scheduling & Clinical Workflow Optimization Project**

---

## 2. Project Summary

This project focuses on improving the clinic workflow for:

- Patient check-ins  
- Vitals collection  
- Physician review  
- Lab processing  
- Patient portal updates  

**Goal:** Reduce wait times, improve appointment accuracy, eliminate manual errors, and streamline communication between reception, nurses, physicians, and lab technicians.  

**Includes:**

- BRD (Business Requirements Document)  
- FRD (Functional Requirements Document)  
- BPMN & Flowcharts  
- User Stories (JIRA-ready)  
- Test Cases (SIT/UAT)  
- Sample dashboard (optional later)  
- Change request example  
- Communication plan  

This portfolio project demonstrates my ability to support technical teams, track changes, collect requirements, and communicate with stakeholders — directly aligned with Leidos project and support roles.

## 3. Business Problem

The current scheduling and patient flow system is outdated and inconsistent. Staff rely on spreadsheets, manual check-in logs, and emails, causing:  

- Long patient wait times  
- Errors in scheduling  
- Lost or duplicated patient records  
- Poor communication between departments  
- No real-time status updates  
- Manual lab routing and delays  
- No single source of truth  

This negatively impacts both staff productivity and patient satisfaction.

✔ Reduce patient wait times by improving workflow  
✔ Standardize scheduling & check-in process  
✔ Ensure accurate routing between departments  
✔ Improve visibility of patient status for staff  
✔ Reduce manual data entry  
✔ Support compliance & record accuracy
